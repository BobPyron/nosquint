<h2>Options Tab</h2>
<h3>General Options</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Primary zoom method</b>
            <p>The primary zoom method specifies the behaviour of the standard
            zoom adjustment shortcuts (ctrl-plus, ctrl-minus, ctrl-mousewheel).
            With <code>Full Page Zoom</code>, both images and text will be zoomed;
            with <code>Text Zoom</code>, only text is zoomed.  Whichever zoom method
            is <i>not</i> set to be primary is referred to as the secondary method.</p>

            <p>The shift key can be added to any of the shortcuts to control the
            secondary zoom method.  For example, if the primary zoom method is
            set to Full Page Zoom, and ctrl-shift-plus is pressed, only text size will
            be increased.</p>
            

        <b>Default primary zoom level</b>
            <p>This is the zoom level of the primary zoom method as applied to
            all pages by default.  A value of 100% is the standard Firefox zoom
            level without NoSquint.  With NoSquint, you can override this value
            to be larger or smaller.</p>

            <p>Modifying the zoom when visiting a web page will override this
            value for that site.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Zoom increment</b>
            <p>You can change the zoom level for a page from the View menu, by
            using one of the zoom shortcuts (ctrl-plus/minus or
            ctrl-mousewheel), or by using the optional toolbar buttons.
            NoSquint can remember these changes.  This setting specifies what
            increment, in percent, to use when changing the zoom level.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enable zoom with ctrl-mousewheel</b>
            <p>Selecting this option allows you to adjust the zoom level by
            pressing and holding the control key while moving the mousewheel up
            or down.  If ctrl-shift-mousewheel is used, this controls the
            secondary zoom method.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Show current zoom levels in status bar</b>
            <p>Selecting this option shows the zoom levels (both full page and
            text zoom) in the status bar for the current web page.  When
            hovering over the status panel, a tooltip will appear providing
            more information.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Site Options</h3>

<p>To NoSquint, a site is a web location where all pages under that location
have the same zoom level, and the site name is derived from the page's
URL.</p>

<p>In most cases, the site is the domain.  For example, if the current page is
<code>www2.ibm.com/index.php</code>, NoSquint will consider the site name to be
<code>ibm.com</code>.  NoSquint will also take into account common
second-level domains.  For example, if you're visiting
<code>www.bbc.co.uk</code>, NoSquint will consider the site name to be
<code>bbc.co.uk</code>.</p>

<p>The default behaviour should work almost all the time.  When it doesn't, you
can control how NoSquint determines site names in the Exceptions Tab.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Remember zoom level per site</b>
            <p>With this option selected, NoSquint will remember any changes
            you make to the zoom levels for a given site.  Both full page zoom
            and text zoom levels are remembered independently.  Next time you
            visit that site, NoSquint will change the zoom to the levels
            previously used on that site.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Forget zoom settings for sites not visited in the last ...</b>
            <p>With the "remember zoom levels per site" option enabled,
            NoSquint keeps track of all zoom level changes for sites, even
            sites you only visit once.  This option is house cleaning: if you
            haven't visited a site (for which you've set a non-default zoom
            level) for the specified number of months, NoSquint will forget the
            setting.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Use the default zoom level for all sites</b>
            <p>One of NoSquint's features is the ability to remember custom
            zoom levels for individual sites.  If you're not interested this
            and want to use the same level for all sites, or you just don't
            want NoSquint to remember any manual changes, select this
            option.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Exceptions Tab</h2>

<p>Because not all web sites are structured the same, sometimes the default
logic NoSquint uses to determine the site name doesn't work the way you want it
to.  By way of exceptions, you can control how NoSquint determines what
constitutes a separate site.</p>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>Exceptions are powerful and expressive, and unfortunately can be confusing.
Before going into a detailed explanation, let's first examine some common
use-cases.  Hopefully one of these examples applies to your case.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> different subdomains on SourceForge, e.g.
        <code>freevo.sourceforge.net</code> and
        <code>audacity.sourceforge.net</code>, are wrongly treated as the same
        site (<code>sourceforge.net</code>)<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>*.sourceforge.net</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> <code>example.com/users/mary</code> and
        <code>example.com/users/john</code> are wrongly treated as the same
        site (<code>example.com</code>)<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>example.com/users/*</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> I use Google Mail (<code>mail.google.com</code>) and
        Google Reader (<code>google.com/reader</code>) and would like these
        treated as sites separate from <code>google.com</code><br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>mail.google.com</code>; add another exception with the pattern
        <code>google.com/reader</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> my company's intranet is at
        <code>intra.example.com</code>, but I'd like our wiki, located under
        <code>intra.example.com/wiki</code> to be treated separately from the
        rest of the intranet.<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>intra.example.com/wiki</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> Google Mail, Google Groups, and in fact all hosts on
        Google should be treated as separate sites.  But the country (the
        top-level domain) shouldn't matter.  So <code>mail.google.ca</code>
        should be the same site as <code>mail.google.de</code>, but a different
        site from <code>groups.google.de</code>, which itself would be the same
        site as <code>groups.google.fi</code><br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern <code>*.google.[*]</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> my company has several web applications that are
        distributed across multiple servers.
        <code>example.com/server1/apps/app1</code> should be considered the
        same site as <code>example.com/server2/apps/app1</code>, but there
        could also be <code>example.com/server1/apps/app3</code> that should be
        a separate site.<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>example.com/[*]/apps/*</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> same scenario the previous one, but sometimes the
        server isn't in the URL, so <code>example.com/apps/app1</code> is
        the same site as <code>example.com/server1/apps/app1</code>.<br/>

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>example.com/[**]apps/*</code>
    </li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Gory Details</h3>
<p>What follows is a technical explanation of exceptions.  If you're not an
advanced user, this section may create a fair amount of confusion; refer
instead to the use-cases above to follow by example.</p>

<p>Exception patterns may contain zero or more of the following possible wildcards:
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>*</code> &ndash; When included in the host name, matches any character
        except a dot ('.').  When included in the path, matches any character
        except a slash ('/').  Does not match the empty string.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>**</code> &ndash; Matches any sequence of characters.  Does match
        the empty string.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Site names are arbitrary strings that represent a given site and are
computed by NoSquint based on the current page's URL and the user-defined list
of exceptions.  For instance, both <code>foo.example.com</code> and
<code>myapp.*.example.com</code> could be site names, depending on the
exceptions defined.  NoSquint looks up zoom levels based on the site name.  The
site name, as determined by NoSquint, is by default displayed in the status bar
beside the current zoom level.</p>

<p>When a wildcard is enclosed in square brackets (i.e. <code>[*]</code> or
<code>[**]</code>), the literal wildcard (<code>*</code> or <code>**</code>)
will be used in the site name instead of the characters the wildcard matches.
This is allows you to group together locations.  For example, if the page's URL
is <code>google.ca</code> and you've defined an exception
<code>google.[*]</code>, the site name will be <code>google.*</code>.  Since
<code>google.fi</code> matches this pattern, the site name would also be
<code>google.*</code>.  Therefore, <code>google.ca</code> and
<code>google.fi</code> would be considered the same site.</p>

<p>Hostnames and paths are evaluated separately; an exception pattern is split
into two sub-patterns, one for the host, and one for the path.  These
sub-patterns match substrings, but hosts are right-anchored, while paths are
left-anchored.  This means that any wildcards specified in the host name will
not match any characters in the path, and vice versa.  When the hostname part
of a pattern is only <code>*</code>, it matches the domain of the page's URL.
For example, for <code>www.google.com</code>, a single <code>*</code> matches
<code>google.com</code>; for <code>www.bbc.co.uk</code> it matches
<code>bbc.co.uk</code>.</p>

<p>When multiple exceptions match a page's URL, NoSquint will use the exception
that matches the most non-wildcard characters in the host name.  If there are
still multiple exceptions in that narrowed list, the exception that matches the
most non-wildcard characters in the path is then chosen.  If still there are
multiple exceptions, the first one that matched is chosen.</p>
