<h2>Options Tab</h2>
<h3>General Options</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Default text zoom level</b>
            <p>This is the zoom level applied to all pages by default.  A value
            of 100% is the standard Firefox text size without NoSquint.  With
            NoSquint, you can override this value to be larger or smaller.</p>

            <p>Modifying the text zoom when visiting a web page will override this
            value for that site.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Zoom increment</b>
            <p>You can change the text zoom for a page from the View menu, by
            using one of the text zoom shortcuts (ctrl-plus/minus or
            ctrl-mousewheel), or by using the optional toolbar buttons.
            NoSquint will remember these changes.  This setting specifies what
            increment, in percent, to use when changing the zoom level.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enable text zoom with ctrl-mousewheel</b>
            <p>Selecting this option allows you to adjust the text zoom level
            by pressing and holding the control key while moving the mousewheel
            up or down.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Show current zoom level and site in status bar</b>
            <p>Selecting this option shows the zoom level and site name in the
            status bar for the current web page.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Site Options</h3>

<p>To NoSquint, a site is a web location where all pages under that location
have the same zoom level, and the site name is derived from the page's
URL.</p>

<p>In most cases, the site is the domain.  For example, if the current page is
<code>www2.ibm.com/index.php</code>, NoSquint will consider the site name to be
<code>ibm.com</code>.  NoSquint will also take into account common
second-level domains.  For example, if you're visiting
<code>www.bbc.co.uk</code>, NoSquint will consider the site name to be
<code>bbc.co.uk</code>.</p>

<p>The default behaviour should work almost all the time.  When it doesn't, you
can control how NoSquint determines site names in the Exceptions Tab.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Use the default text zoom level for all sites</b>
            <p>One of NoSquint's features is the ability to remember custom
            text zoom levels for individual sites.  If you're not interested
            this and want to use the same level for all sites, or you just
            don't want NoSquint to remember any manual changes, select this
            option.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Remember text zoom level per site</b>
            <p>With this option selected, NoSquint will remember any changes
            you make to the text zoom level (via ctrl-plus/minus keys or
            ctrl-mousewheel) for a given site.  Next time you visit that site,
            NoSquint will change the text zoom to the level previously used on
            that site.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Forget zoom settings for sites not visited in the last ...</b>
            <p>With the "remember text zoom level per site" option enabled,
            NoSquint keeps track of all zoom level changes for sites, even
            sites you only visit once.  This option is house cleaning: if you
            haven't visited a site (for which you've set a non-default zoom
            level) for the specified number of months, NoSquint will forget the
            setting.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Zoom level for the current site (example.com)</b>
            <p>Sets the text zoom level to the specified value for the site in
            the current browser tab or window.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Exceptions Tab</h2>

<p>Because not all web sites are structured the same, sometimes the default
logic NoSquint uses to determine the site name doesn't work the way you want it
to.  By way of exceptions, you can control how NoSquint determines what
constitutes a separate site.</p>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>Exceptions are powerful and expressive, and unfortunately can be confusing.
Before going into a detailed explanation, let's first examine some common
use-cases.  Hopefully one of these examples applies to your case.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> different subdomains on SourceForge, e.g.
        <code>freevo.sourceforge.net</code> and
        <code>audacity.sourceforge.net</code>, are wrongly treated as the same
        site (<code>sourceforge.net</code>)<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>*.sourceforge.net</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> <code>example.com/users/mary</code> and
        <code>example.com/users/john</code> are wrongly treated as the same
        site (<code>example.com</code>)<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>example.com/users/*</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> I use Google Mail (<code>mail.google.com</code>) and
        Google Reader (<code>google.com/reader</code>) and would like these
        treated as sites separate from <code>google.com</code><br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>mail.google.com</code>; add another exception with the pattern
        <code>google.com/reader</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> my company's intranet is at
        <code>intra.example.com</code>, but I'd like our wiki, located under
        <code>intra.example.com/wiki</code> to be treated separately from the
        rest of the intranet.<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>intra.example.com/wiki</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> Google Mail, Google Groups, and in fact all hosts on
        Google should be treated as separate sites.  But the country (the
        top-level domain) shouldn't matter.  So <code>mail.google.ca</code>
        should be the same site as <code>mail.google.de</code>, but a different
        site from <code>groups.google.de</code>, which itself would be the same
        site as <code>groups.google.fi</code><br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern <code>*.google.[*]</code>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> my company has several web applications that are
        distributed across multiple servers.
        <code>example.com/server1/apps/app1</code> should be considered the
        same site as <code>example.com/server2/apps/app1</code>, but there
        could also be <code>example.com/server1/apps/app3</code> that should be
        a separate site.<br />

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>example.com/[*]/apps/*</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Problem:</b> same scenario the previous one, but sometimes the
        server isn't in the URL, so <code>example.com/apps/app1</code> is
        the same site as <code>example.com/server1/apps/app1</code>.<br/>

        <b>Solution:</b> add an exception with the pattern
        <code>example.com/[**]apps/*</code>
    </li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Gory Details</h3>
<p>What follows is a technical explanation of exceptions.  If you're not an
advanced user, this section may create a fair amount of confusion; refer
instead to the use-cases above to follow by example.</p>

<p>Exception patterns may contain zero or more of the following possible wildcards:
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>*</code> &ndash; When included in the host name, matches any character
        except a dot ('.').  When included in the path, matches any character
        except a slash ('/').  Does not match the empty string.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>**</code> &ndash; Matches any sequence of characters.  Does match
        the empty string.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Site names are arbitrary strings that represent a given site and are
computed by NoSquint based on the current page's URL and the user-defined list
of exceptions.  For instance, both <code>foo.example.com</code> and
<code>myapp.*.example.com</code> could be site names, depending on the
exceptions defined.  NoSquint looks up zoom levels based on the site name.  The
site name, as determined by NoSquint, is by default displayed in the status bar
beside the current zoom level.</p>

<p>When a wildcard is enclosed in square brackets (i.e. <code>[*]</code> or
<code>[**]</code>), the literal wildcard (<code>*</code> or <code>**</code>)
will be used in the site name instead of the characters the wildcard matches.
This is allows you to group together locations.  For example, if the page's URL
is <code>google.ca</code> and you've defined an exception
<code>google.[*]</code>, the site name will be <code>google.*</code>.  Since
<code>google.fi</code> matches this pattern, the site name would also be
<code>google.*</code>.  Therefore, <code>google.ca</code> and
<code>google.fi</code> would be considered the same site.</p>

<p>Hostnames and paths are evaluated separately; an exception pattern is split
into two sub-patterns, one for the host, and one for the path.  These
sub-patterns match substrings, but hosts are right-anchored, while paths are
left-anchored.  This means that any wildcards specified in the host name will
not match any characters in the path, and vice versa.  When the hostname part
of a pattern is only <code>*</code>, it matches the domain of the page's URL.
For example, for <code>www.google.com</code>, a single <code>*</code> matches
<code>google.com</code>; for <code>www.bbc.co.uk</code> it matches
<code>bbc.co.uk</code>.</p>

<p>When multiple exceptions match a page's URL, NoSquint will use the exception
that matches the most non-wildcard characters in the host name.  If there are
still multiple exceptions in that narrowed list, the exception that matches the
most non-wildcard characters in the path is then chosen.  If still there are
multiple exceptions, the last one is chosen.</p>
